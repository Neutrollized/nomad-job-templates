# README
[Komiser](https://komiser.io/) is actually a really cool too and works with many cloud providers and it's [free](https://github.com/mlabouardy/komiser)!

So I encourage you to check it out as I just found out about it myself and so far I like it...


## Note
For various cloud providers, you will need the appropriate IAM permissions to allow Komiser to probe your account for data to populate its dashboard.
- [AWS IAM policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlabouardy/komiser/master/policy.json)
- GCP requires a service account with **Viewer** perms
