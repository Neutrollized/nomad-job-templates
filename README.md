# nomad-job-templates
HashiCorp's [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) isn't as popular as Kubernetes and there aren't as many resources/examples out there that show how to setup job/deployments in Nomad, so I've created some job templates for commonly used tool that one might have in their systems design.  Hope this helps!

The current job templates all follow Nomad v0.12.0+ specifications.
